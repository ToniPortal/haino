# Haino
[![Release](https://github.com/ToniPortal/haino/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/ToniPortal/haino/actions/workflows/main.yml)

An <kbd>alt</kbd>+<kbd>space</kbd> launcher for Windows, built with Electron.

I always dreamed of an alternative to Alfred on Windows, that is made with JavaScript.
so, I made it.

## Vision

It's a launcher with strict syntax (like terminal programs), it's not targeting to interpret natural language.  
I believe the strict syntax can provide more powerful and fast response than to interpret natural language.
